Modify the program in such a way that the motion equation is solved without electric field but with magnetic field quadratically growing
in the direction of y

E = (0, 0, 0) 

B = (0, 0, Bz) 

$Bz = B0*(\frac{y}{y0})^2$

q0 = (0, 0, 0, v0, v0, 0) 

Do you observe any drift? For what values of B0, y0 and v0 did you observe it? What is the direction of the drift velocity for an electron and for a positron? 

Now let the electric field change harmonically with time:

Ex = E0 · cos (ωt)

Ey = 0

Ez = 0

and set the initial velocity to

vx = 0

vy = v0

vz = 0

Examine for several frequencies ω (for example 106, 107, 108 and 109 Hz) the motion of a proton and an electron.
- How do they react to the field?
- Compare how easily the electron and proton are influenced by the external field for various frequencies.
